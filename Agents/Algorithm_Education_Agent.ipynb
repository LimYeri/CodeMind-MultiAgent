In this case it is more common to remove the minimum element from the remainder of the list, and then insert it at the end of the values sorted so far. For example:\\n\\narr[] = 64 25 12 22 11\\n\\n// Find the minimum element in arr[0...4]\\n// and place it at beginning\\n11 25 12 22 64\\n\\n// Find the minimum element in arr[1...4]\\n// and place it at beginning of arr[1...4]\\n11 12 25 22 64\\n\\n// Find the minimum element in arr[2...4]\\n// and place it at beginning of arr[2...4]\\n11 12 22 25 64\\n\\n// Find the minimum element in arr[3...4]\\n// and place it at beginning of arr[3...4]\\n11 12 22 25 64 \\n\\n\\n== Implementations ==\\nBelow is an implementation in C.\\n\\n\\n== Complexity ==\\nSelection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to other sorting algorithms, since none of the loops depend on the data in the array.

Among the authors of early sorting algorithms around 1951 was Betty Holberton, who worked on ENIAC and UNIVAC. Bubble sort was analyzed as early as 1956. Asymptotically optimal algorithms have been known since the mid-20th century –  new algorithms are still being invented, with the widely used Timsort dating to 2002, and the library sort being first published in 2006.\\nComparison sorting algorithms have a fundamental requirement of Ω(n log n) comparisons (some input sequences will require a multiple of n log n comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array to be sorted). Algorithms not based on comparisons, such as counting sort, can have better performance.\\nSorting algorithms are prevalent in introductory computer science classes, where the abundance of algorithms for the problem provides a gentle introduction to a variety of core algorithm concepts, such as big O notation, divide-and-conquer algorithms, data structures such as heaps and binary trees, randomized algorithms, best, worst and average case analysis, time–space tradeoffs, and upper and lower bounds.\\nSorting small arrays optimally (in fewest comparisons and swaps) or fast (i.e. taking into account machine specific details) is still an open research problem, with solutions only known for very small arrays (<20 elements). Similarly optimal (by various definitions) sorting on a parallel machine is an open research topic.\\n\\n\\n== Classification ==\\nSorting algorithms can be classified by:\\n\\nComputational complexity\\nBest, worst and average case behavior in terms of the size of the list. For typical serial sorting algorithms, good behavior is O(n log n), with parallel sort in O(log2 n), and bad behavior is O(n2). Ideal behavior for a serial sort is O(n), but this is not possible in the average case. Optimal parallel sorting is O(log n).\\nSwaps for \"in-place\" algorithms.\\nMemory usage (and use of other computer resources). In particular, some sorting algorithms are \"in-place\". Strictly, an in-place sort needs only O(1) memory beyond the items being sorted; sometimes O(log n) additional memory is considered \"in-place\".\\nRecursion: Some algorithms are either recursive or non-recursive, while others may be both (e.g., merge sort).\\nStability: stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e., values).\\nWhether or not they are a comparison sort. A comparison sort examines the data only by comparing two elements with a comparison operator.\\nGeneral method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging, etc. Exchange sorts include bubble sort and quicksort. Selection sorts include cycle sort and heapsort.\\nWhether the algorithm is serial or parallel. The remainder of this discussion almost exclusively concentrates upon serial algorithms and assumes serial operation.\\nAdaptability: Whether or not the preso')]"

      "1. **Dividing the Input List**: The algorithm starts by dividing the input list into two parts:\n",
      "   - Sorted Sublist: Initially empty, it will gradually build up from left to right.\n",
      "   - Unsorted Sublist: Initially, the entire input list is unsorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sorting Process**:\n",
      "   - The algorithm repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist.\n",
      "   - It then swaps this element with the leftmost element of the unsorted sublist, putting it in its correct sorted position.\n",
      "   - The boundaries of the sorted and unsorted sublists are adjusted accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Example**:\n",
      "   Let's sort an array `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]` using Selection Sort:\n",
      "   - Find the minimum element in the entire array and swap it with the first element: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`\n",
      "   - Find the minimum element in the remaining array and swap it with the second element: `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`\n",
      "   - Repeat this process until the whole array is sorted: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`\n",

      "   - Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means its efficiency decreases for large lists compared to more advanced algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.\n",
      "   - However, Selection Sort can be advantageous in situations where auxiliary memory is limited due to its in-place sorting nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Selection Sort is a straightforward algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part, gradually sorting the entire list. While it may not be the most efficient for large datasets, its simplicity and minimal memory usage make it a viable option in certain scenarios.\n"

       "1. **Dividing the Input List**: The algorithm starts by dividing the input list into two parts:\n",
       "   - Sorted Sublist: Initially empty, it will gradually build up from left to right.\n",
       "   - Unsorted Sublist: Initially, the entire input list is unsorted.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Sorting Process**:\n",
       "   - The algorithm repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted sublist.\n",
       "   - It then swaps this element with the leftmost element of the unsorted sublist, putting it in its correct sorted position.\n",
       "   - The boundaries of the sorted and unsorted sublists are adjusted accordingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Example**:\n",
       "   Let's sort an array `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]` using Selection Sort:\n",
       "   - Find the minimum element in the entire array and swap it with the first element: `[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]`\n",
       "   - Find the minimum element in the remaining array and swap it with the second element: `[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]`\n",
       "   - Repeat this process until the whole array is sorted: `[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]`\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Efficiency**:\n",
       "   - Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means its efficiency decreases for large lists compared to more advanced algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.\n",
       "   - However, Selection Sort can be advantageous in situations where auxiliary memory is limited due to its in-place sorting nature.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Selection Sort is a straightforward algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part, gradually sorting the entire list. While it may not be the most efficient for large datasets, its simplicity and minimal memory usage make it a viable option in certain scenarios."
